# WalkAround3D


Emanuel W. Nov 22, 2018

Free walk forward and backward using 'w' and 's', respectively. <br /> 
You cannot move through the exhibits or walls. <br /> 
You can use the mouse to look around or you can use 'a'/'d'. <br /> 
Pressing 'a'/'d' will align your Y view angle to be parallel with the floor.  <br /> 
Furtheremore, it will align your X angle to the nearest 90 degree angle (warning, if you choose to use the mouse and hit 'a'/'d', your view will try to rotate to the nearest 90 degree angle. So, if you move against that animation with your mouse it will keep trying to finish the animation. <br /> 
If you want to use the mouse and 'a'/'d', let it get to the nearest 90 degree angle before moving the mouse again). <br />
