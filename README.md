# WalkAround3D


Emanuel W. Nov 22, 2018

Free walk forward and backward using 'w' and 's', respectively.
You cannot move through the exhibits or walls.
You can use the mouse to look around or you can use 'a'/'d'.
Pressing 'a'/'d' will align your Y view angle to be parallel with the floor. 
Furtheremore, it will align your X angle to the nearest 90 degree angle 
(warning, if you choose to use the mouse and hit 'a'/'d', your view will 
try to rotate to the nearest 90 degree angle. So, if you move against 
that animation with your mouse it will keep trying to finish the animation.
If you want to use the mouse and 'a'/'d', let it get to the nearest 
90 degree angle before moving the mouse again).
